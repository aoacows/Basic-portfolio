        HI, my names Matthew Prieto and this is my Portfolio! usually id start these things
        with a joke but that doesn't seem imperative at the moment. Im a learning
        developer and this is one of my first project? more like homework but thats
        besides the point haha! its a very daunting class to say the least but i think 
        i can manage.
